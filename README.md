# week3-discrete-signals-matlab


This project contains MATLAB code (`discrete_signals.m`) for plotting and analyzing discrete-time signals.

## Signals Included
1. **Unit Impulse (δ[n])** – A signal that is 1 at n=0 and 0 otherwise.  
2. **Unit Step (u[n])** – A signal that is 0 for n<0 and 1 for n≥0.  
3. **Exponential Signal** – Discrete exponential growth/decay.  
4. **Sinusoidal Signal** – Discrete sine wave.

## Sample Plots
